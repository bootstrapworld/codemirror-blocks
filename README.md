        // feel free to include the example css, or roll your own!
        require('codemirror-blocks/example/example.css')

        let cm = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById('mytextarea'))
        let blocks = new CodeMirrorBlocks(cm, new MyParser())
        blocks.setBlockMode(true)
