The files here are a giant hack. Pyret code uses require-js style
imports, which are not directly compatible with es6-style imports and
exports. I (Justin) tried and failed to import it in three different
ways; so for the moment this directory contains copy-pasted Pyret
files with modified import statements.

If you can figure out how to import these files sanely, please do so.
